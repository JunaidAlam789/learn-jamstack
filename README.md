# Learn JAMstack Serverless in Baby Steps using Gatsby.js, React, Contentful, Storybook, Netlify, FaunaDB, Hasura, Firebase, Algolia, GitHub Actions, Web Assembly, Project Fugu, and CSS Houdini

Here we will learn to develop blazingly fast and scalable modern websites and apps using JAMstack and Serverless technologies.

In this repo we will learn how to develop JAMstack PWA's using Gatsby.js, Contentful, Netlify, FaunaDB, Hasura, Firebase, and GitHub Actions. If you don't have web programming background or don't know React we suggest you start from this [web development bootcamp](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2020/).

Before starting the steps we suggest reading the following articles:
